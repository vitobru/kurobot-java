**Info:**

This is a small Discord bot written sitting on top of the Javacord library. Still in its alpha stages of development, it ~~can~~ will eventually perform some basic tasks such as latency, uptime, and playing uploaded mp3 files in VC, all prefaced by the $ parameter (eventually customisable). You ~~can~~ will eventually be able to disable commands on a per-server basis as those transactions will be stored in a SQL DB file.

**Prerequisites:**

- Javacord v3.8.0 or later

Please note that, since we're now using Java, Windows is fully supported, now!
